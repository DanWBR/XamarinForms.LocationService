# Background Location Service

XamarinForms.LocationService is an application that refreshes every 2 seconds GPS location. For years I have been working developing mobile apps that require location features; hopefully, the current project will save you some time in regarding service and location management in your Xamarin application for Android and iOS.

  - Location Updates
  - Location Permissions Management
  - Background Processing Management

# Components used

  - Xamarin.Essentials
  - MessagingCenter
  - CLLocationManager
